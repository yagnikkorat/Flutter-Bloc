Bloc state management

# 'bloc' vs 'flutter bloc'

The 'bloc' package contains things you will use in your Bloc layer, like the Bloc class. This isn't necessarily flutter dependent, it is just the logic architecture of your app.

The 'flutter bloc' package contains elements you will use in your UI layer. It includes widgets like BlocProvider and BlocBuilder, which are widgets and thus flutter dependent.
